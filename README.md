#### For large changes spanning many commits / PRs

* Create a meta-issue with a bullet list using the `* [ ] item` markdown syntax.
* Create issues for each bullet point
* Link to the meta-issue from each bullet point issue
* Check off the bullet list as items get completed

Linking from the bullet point issues to the meta issue will create a list of issues
with status indicators in the issue comments stream, which will give us a quick visual reference
to see what's done and what still needs doing.
