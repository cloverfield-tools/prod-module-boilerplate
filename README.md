An npm `scripts` boilerplate for modules intended for production.


## Features

* ES6 with Babel
* Lint with ESLint
* Tape tests with coverage report
* Dependency security audits with nsp
* Ensure dependencies are properly declared in package.json
* Git precommit hook enforces quality checks on commit
* Travis CI integration


## Getting Started

### Clone the repo

In a bash terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:ericelliott/prod-module-boilerplate.git <your-new-repo-name>
cd <your-repo-name>
rm -rf <.git> # strip the boilerplate .git config
git init # create your own .git config
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

### Customize package.json

Open up `package.json`. At minimum, you'll need to customize the `name`, `description`, & `version` fields.


### Configure your CI build

This package comes with a `.travis.yml` file. You'll need to replace it with your own build config. If you want to continue using TravisCI and you don't see any problems with the config, replacing `.travis.yml` is optional. You still need to activate [Travis CI for your repository](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).


### Customize the README.md file

Pop open README.md. Find this text:

```
[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/ericelliott/prod-module-boilerplate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ericelliott/prod-module-boilerplate)
```

And replace it with your info:

```
[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/<your-github-name>/<your-github-repo-name>.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/<your-github-name>/<your-github-repo-name>)
```

You'll probably also want to replace the content of "Getting Started" & "Features", and ensure that you're refering to the correct repository in the "Contributing" document.
